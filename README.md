# Interoperability of Digital Geographic Information in the Domain of Maritime Navigation

## Abstract

> This thesis examines interoperability of digital geographic information (DGI) in the context of maritime navigation. Maritime navigation is a complex domain that draws on a wide variety of information resources. The diversity and multitude of such information creates challenges with respect to interoperability â€“ the ability of software and hardware systems on multiple machines from multiple vendors to communicate with each other meaningfully. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is continually developing a series of standards for DGI that may provide solutions for DGI interoperability in the domain of maritime navigation. This thesis examines the OGC Web Services (OWS) and how the Web Feature Service (WFS) can be adopted to serve Notice to Mariners (NTM).
